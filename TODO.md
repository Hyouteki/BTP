- [ ] familiarizing with object detection models such as [yolo](https://github.com/Hyouteki/BTP/tree/main/yolo), [tflite](https://github.com/Hyouteki/BTP/tree/main/tflite)
    > detecting objects in a video and using that in furthur anomaly detection such as collisions/accidents, running in hallway, etc; which requires computation of interaction between objects not detection.
- [ ] socket programming 
- [ ] dataset training
